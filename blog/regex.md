##### Using Regular expressions in Javascript {#using-regular-expressions-in-javascript .mume-header}

``` {.language-javascript data-role="codeBlock" data-info="js"}
const re = /EX$/
const str = "We're learning REGEX"

const li = [ 1, 2, di ];
const re = /regex/i;

console.log(re.test(`learning about regex`));
console.log(re.test(`LEARNING ABOUT REGEX`));

let count = 0;

const newStr = str.replace(/e/ig, match => {
      count += 1
      return count;
    });
    console.log(newStr);
const di = { name: `Mimi`, age: 2 };
const str = `My name is %name% and I am %age% years old`;
const str2 = `My name is ${name} and I am ${age} years old`;
const re = /%\w+%/g

const replaced = str.replace(re, match => {
  // match = %name%
  const key = match.replace(/%/g, ``);
  // key = name
  return di[key];
});
console.log(replaced);
```

##### You construct a regular expression in one of two ways: {#you-construct-a-regular-expression-in-one-of-two-ways .mume-header}

-   Using a regular expression literal, which consists of a pattern
    enclosed between slashes, as follows:

``` {.language-javascript data-role="codeBlock" data-info="js"}
let re = /ab+c/;
```

Regular expression literals provide compilation of the regular
expression when the script is loaded. If the regular expression remains
constant, using this can improve performance.

-   Or calling the constructor function of the RegExp object, as
    follows:

``` {.language-javascript data-role="codeBlock" data-info="js"}
let re = new RegExp('ab+c');
```

#### Escaping {#escaping .mume-header}

-   If you need to use any of the special characters literally (actually
    searching for a "\*", for instance), you must escape it by putting a
    backslash in front of it.
